# cpp-journey
Work with me, as i go along in my CPP journey. Advice is always welcome, as it help me to become a better coder! Looking to get into kernel compilation at somepoint, 
in hopes of creating a completely new (or maybe a fork/spin) linux distrobution. Also interested in game/software development
